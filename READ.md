Our Etsy app let's Etsy users search and filter for items they can't normally search for on Etsy's website. Users will be able to see items outside the U.S., items that no one else has viewed yet or the most popular items, and items only made directly by the seller. They can also choose to forward items to their friends. 

We want to implement functionality that is outside Etsy's simple filter features so users can have more options when they're choosing items to buy. 

1. When a user types in the Search bar they will return a listen of 12 items that match the searched term the closest. 

The search results page will populate as the user is typing. 

2. When a user clicks the "arrow" buttons they will go through the next and previous page results. 

3. When a user clicks the "International" checkbox, only items that are outside the U.S. will populate.

4. When a user clicks the "made by seller" checkbox, only items that are made by the seller will appear. 

5. When a user inputs a number of views the item has it will update the thumbnail boxes below. 

6. When a user clicks on an item thumbnail they get a bigger view of the item next to the "search term" 

7. When a user clicks the "share to instagram" button it will post their piocture to their instagram. 

8. When a user clicks the "Save" button it will send the item lsiting to their email.

9. When a user clicks the "arrow" buttons they will go through the next and previous page results.
